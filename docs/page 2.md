I am a practitioner [^1] and coder seeking dialogue with the Solid community after reading the book [This Is For Everyone](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/tim-berners-lee/this-is-for-everyone/9781035023677) 
in which Sir Tim Berners-Lee explains how it is important for everyone that the web serves 
everyone. I generally agree with the views he expresses and with those I have seen in the 
Solid community. From a slightly different perspective, I would also argue that software tools 
could and should be made more accessible to everyone.

Jensen Huang predicts that "AI is going to eat software" in reference to Marc Andreessen's
prediction in 2011 that [software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/).
Behind these humourous sound-bites, however, the effect on the world is more serious : software is 
a medium throught which humans are given agengy, so when AI swallows software humans will lose.
I propose the term "natural computing" as both the literal opposite and the logical accompaniment 
to "artificial intelligence" : the ability to instruct computers could be made much more accessible 
to all, to the point where it becomes a basic literacy.

[^1]: The word "practitioner" can mean different things in different contexts. It is employed here in 
the sense of the [merriam-webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/practitioner) definition :
"one who practices or is regularly engaged in a skillful activity", and in particular here one who 
is engaged in the practical application of something developed by software specialists.
It it used in place of the word "user" to reduce the risk of implying passivity or ignorance.

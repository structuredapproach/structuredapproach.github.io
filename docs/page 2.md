I am a data-smith [^1] and coder seeking community dialogue about the semantic web after reading 
the book [This Is For Everyone](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/tim-berners-lee/this-is-for-everyone/9781035023677) 
in which Sir Tim Berners-Lee explains how it is important for everyone that the web serves 
everyone. I like the idea of transforming the web from an attention economy to an intention economy.
Furthermore, I think the need to transform our tools applies at a level down from the web also : 
i.e. software tools.

Jensen Huang predicted in 2017 that "AI is going to eat software" in a neat reference to Marc Andreessen's
prediction in 2011 that [software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/).
All this canibalism is having a serious effect on the world ! Software is an important 
medium through which humans are given agengy, so as AI swallows software : humans lose out.
I propose the term "natural computing" as both the literal opposite and the logical accompaniment 
to "artificial intelligence" : the ability to instruct computers could be made much more accessible 
to all, to the point where it becomes a basic literacy.

[^1]: The term data-smith is introduced here to describe people who work with data, in a loosely 
similar way to a blacksmith works with iron, or a locksmith works with locks.
